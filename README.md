# Godzamok Roar
Cookie Clicker steam workshop mod and browser bookmarklet addon to automate triggering Godzamok. Press G to sell all farms, and immediately buy 100. 

Selling buildings triggers the pantheon deity Godzamok's active ability, Devastation. The Devastation ability stacks. In normal gameplay, repeatedly selling and buying buildings is tedious, and doing so more than a couple times would waste the full duration of the ability. With this, you can mash or even hold down the key.
The price of buildings increases exponentially the more you currently own, so this addon sells all buildings before buying 100 again, to work with blocks of 100 at the lowest possible price. Farms are the least useful building.

This works with either the steam release of Cookie Clicker, or the browser version.

## Browser
In your web browser, make a new bookmark, and edit the url. Replace the url with the text on the following line:

Now, whenever in the Cookie Clicker browser game, navigate to that bookmark to activate the bookmarklet, and the mod will load.

### Prerequisites
First, bake one billion cookies and wait 23 hours to unlock the sugar lumps resource. When you use 1 sugar lump to upgrade temples to level 1, click the View Pantheon button. At this point you have the liberty to decide your loadout, and so long as you choose Godzamok for any of the three slots, this mod will make it easier to keep and stack his bonus.
